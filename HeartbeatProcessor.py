# this is a class that will be used to process and format data from the game ProjectHeartbeat
# project heartbeat is a rhythm game, where the player must press the correct key at the correct time
# the objective of this class is to simplify on screen data into a format that can be used by a neural network

# this class will first access the screen to grab frames from the game
# next step is to process the frames to get the position
